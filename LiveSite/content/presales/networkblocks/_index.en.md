Yes! There are a handful of networks that we've deemed to be complete spam operations and nothing more, and they are fully blocked from our platform. The ASN numbers of the networks which are 100% blocked can be found in the "ASNS=" line in this script: https://github.com/mxroute/da_server_updates/blob/master/sec/fuckthesenetworks.sh
