You are here because you received this bounce error from our SMTP server: "Your account is involved in registration spam attacks and has been blocked from sending until you resolve it"

You can familiarize yourself with what is happening by reading this blog post: https://blog.mxroute.com/the-rise-of-registration-and-password-reset-bombardment/

We're not going to be able to offer you advice on how to solve this. However, your website is taking part in a large scale attack against people's inboxes. Malicious actors are spamming website registrations for these recipients to flood their inbox with emails they didn't ask for. You need to stop your website from being used this way, because we do not want our platform utilized as a means to harass people. Similarly, you shouldn't want your domain involved in this activity that almost certainly will result in recipients marking your emails as spam. This harms your chances for inbox delivery, at the very least.

Once you have resolved this you may open a support ticket with us and detail what you've done to halt it, then request a removal of the block. If the activity continues, the block will be added back.
