This is for people who are not customers of MXroute. If you are a customer, open a ticket. If you are a customer of one of our resellers, you must contact the reseller. If you as a customer (or customer of a reseller) use this method of contact to escalate a support request or what should have been a support request, you will receive one warning, followed by account termination if you continue this behavior.

If you believe we have blocked legitimate and desirable email, not unsolicited marketing email, you can contact jarland@gmail.com to plead your case. If it is known that you are sending unsolicited marketing email, you will not receive any assistance with your request.
