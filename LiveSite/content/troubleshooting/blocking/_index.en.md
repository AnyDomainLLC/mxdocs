This is for people who are not customers of MXroute. If you are a customer, open a ticket. If you as a customer use this method of contact as a means to escalate a support ticket or what should have been a support ticket, you will receive one warning, followed by account termination if you continue this behavior.

If you believe that we have blocked legitimate and desirable email, not unsolicited marketing email, you can reach out to jarland@gmail.com to plead your case. If it is known that you are sending unsolicited marketing email, you will not receive any assistance with your request.
