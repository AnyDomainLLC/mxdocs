We get this a lot. At the core we’re not selling “groupware.” We’re selling email. We’d like to decouple the two from people’s brains. Yes Gsuite and Office 365 include calendars. That’s because they’re selling groupware. We’re selling email. We’re not primarily interested in managing calendars. The opinion here is that you can successfully decouple calendars from your email and use any application you like, and if it isn’t tied to your email then your calendar suddenly becomes portable, modular. That’s pretty ideal, we think.
