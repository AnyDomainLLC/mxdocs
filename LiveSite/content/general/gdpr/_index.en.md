As a company based in the US with no operations (employees, incorporation, etc) inside of the EU we are neutral on the matter of GDPR. We may well be compliant with it, but we make no direct effort to be. As this topic appears to generate a high volume of arguments, please direct any and all arguments on this topic to your own legal advisors. Whether or not this makes it legal for you to do business with us, from your location, is outside of our expertise.
