{{< faq "How do storage allocations work?" >}}
The amount of storage you purchase with any of our plans can be allocated as you desire. However, the collective usage of storage space under the account must remain under that amount or you will need to upgrade to store more. You can even over allocate. So for example you could purchase a 10GB package, allocate 5GB storage each to 100 email addresses, and the limit would only be hit when the combined real usage actually reaches 10GB.
